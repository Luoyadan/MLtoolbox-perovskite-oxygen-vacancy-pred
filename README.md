## Abstract
The development of efficient catalysts is essential to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reactions, which is critical for advancing electrochemical energy systems such as alkaline water electrolysis and high-temperature ceramic fuel cells. Traditional experimental screening of catalysts, particularly for high-temperature applications, is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This research aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the presence of oxygen vacancies in perovskite materials, thereby expediting the catalyst development process.

## Installation
To utilize this repository, please clone the repository as follows:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourrepo/MLtoolbox.git
cd MLtoolbox
```

Be sure to use Python 3.8 and activate the conda environment
```bash
conda create -n ml-pero python=3.8

conda activate ml-pero
```
Then install all the necessary dependencies: 

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

## Usage
### Data Preparation
Ensure that the datasets are correctly placed in the `data` directory.
To reproduce the results for oxygen vacancy prediction, we have prepared a cleaned version of data files:
- `data_Co.xlsx` for Co-based 221 perovskites and 
- `data_Fe.xlsx` for Fe-based 93 perovskites.

Six attributes are pre-calculated:
- Polarization
- Charge
- Electronegativity
- Radius A-site
- Radius B-site
- Temperature

To investigate the detailed list of the perovskites and the procedure of how features are preprocessed, please refer to the folder `data`.


### Model Training and Visualization
We have trained and evaluated 42 regression models on two datasets, with 80% of data used for training and the rest 20% if data for testing. The models are evaluated in a manner of 5-fold cross validation. 

Comprehensive visualisations of regression performance, correlation study are provided. For more details, please refer to the `1_main_prediction.ipynb`.


## Results
Our machine learning models demonstrated significant predictive capabilities for oxygen vacancies in perovskite materials. The results indicate potential pathways for optimizing catalyst design for various electrochemical applications.
