## Abstract
Slow kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction limit the efficiency of many energy conversion and storage systems such as fuel cells and batteries. Pursuing efficient catalysts is paramount to accelerate this process but extremely challenging due to the lack of rationality particularly for oxygen reduction that involves both oxygen-ion surface exchange and bulk diffusion at elevated temperatures, which is drastically different from most of the near-room-temperature catalysis dominated only by the catalyst surfaces. Here we show that the cation-cation inductive interactions that commonly exist in the mixed metal oxides determine the oxygen vacancies of more than 200 state-of-the-art catalysts, which can be well predicted from machine learning based on the lattice cationic environment, requiring no heavy computational and experimental inputs. Our results demonstrate the important role of balancing oxygen vacancy formation and ion transport in the rational catalyst design, which contributes to the discovery of new perovskite oxides that show notably high reactivity and stability to reduce oxygen and consequently enables a solid oxide fuel cell to operate efficiently and stably at below 500 Â°C. We anticipate our work to be a starting point for a paradigm shift towards more rational development of new mixed metal oxides for efficient energy conversion and storage.
